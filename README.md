# Why ?
Skimmer is a simple tool to list the files inside a directory in a recursive manner.
This project is purely for educational purpose. But it can be used for more complex project as well.
Beware ! Some parts of the code might need some improvments as I wanted to test recursive 
algorithm with perl.
